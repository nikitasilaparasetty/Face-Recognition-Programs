# Face-Recognition-Programs


## Program 1 - Face Recognition From Webcam

In this program, we identify the presence of a face from a webcam feed. The program processes the video frame-by-frame, and then displays a box, indicating the location of the face.

The program is written in Python, with the Jupyter Notebook interface. 
It requires the OpenCV (cv2) and System-Specific Parameters and Functions (sys) libraries. 
It uses the Haar Cascade Classifier.
